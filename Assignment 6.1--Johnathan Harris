#Write a program that converts miles driven into kilometers using a function and then display both

#user inputes miles 
miles = float(input("Enter number of miles driven: "))

#function for calculating miles into kilometers
def distance(miles):
    kilometers = miles * 1.60
    return kilometers
kilometers = distance(miles)

#display for both kilometers and miles
print(f"\nDisntance driven in kilometers: {kilometers}")
print(f"\nDisntance driven in miles: {miles}")
